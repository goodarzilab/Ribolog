# Ribolog
A suite of regression-based tools for Ribosome profiling data analysis

## Module 1: CELP (Consistent Excess of Loess Preds) 
Identifies positions of translational pause (stalling) 
and corrects RPF counts to eliminate the impact of stalling bias. The output of CELP can be used to model the
factors that influence translational dynamics. 

## Module 2: PREP 
Normalizes and combines RNA and RPF datasets and shapes them into a format ready for quality control (QC) and translational
efficiency ratio (TER) anlaysis. 

## Module 3: QC 
Includes three powerful tools to quantify and visualize reproducibility among replicates and inform hypothesis generation with respect to biological effects: 
princiapl component analysis (PCA) of TEs, proportion of null features (non-differentially translated transcripts)
and correlation of equivalent TER tests. 

## Module 4: TER 
Tests the size and significance of differential translation
rates among biological samples. Although better results are always obtained with sufficient replicates, __Ribolog__ is able to peform the TER test with only one replicate per sample. The TER test is not restricted to pairwise comparisons; any number of samples described by a list of attributes (covariates) can be compared in a single model. 

## Module 5: Empirical significance testing and Meta-analysis
Offers tools for two important slightly advanced statistical tasks: 1) Empirical null hypothesis testing to reduce false positives in replicated datasets. 
2) Meta-analysis to integrate 
results of biologically related and statistically correlated experiments.

The Ribolog workflow is described in great detail in the package vignettes (RIBOLOG.pdf in the vignettes folder).

## Installing Ribolog

<b> Step 1:</b> Make sure to have all the necessary development tools installed on your system. Run these in the command line to install them: <br/>

In Ubuntu (or computing servers):
```sh
sudo apt-get install build-essential libcurl4-gnutls-dev libxml2-dev libssl-dev libz-dev libbz2-dev liblzma-dev
```

In Linux
```sh
sudo yum groupinstall 'Development Tools'
```

In Mac (if you don't have development tools/ Xcode installed)
```sh
xcode-select --install
```

<b> Step 2:</b>  Run the following commands in R:

```R
install.packages(c('devtools', 'BiocManager'))
BiocManager::install(c("GenomicAlignments", "qvalue"))
devtools::install_github("sohitmiglani/Ribolog", dependencies = TRUE, build_vignettes = FALSE, build_manual = FALSE)
```

Rendering the vignettes during installation requires bam files that are not uploaded onto this repository. The knitted .pdf file should be downloaded directly from the vignettes folder instead.

__Ribolog__ was developed by Hossein Asgharian at UCSF supervised by Hani Goodarzi and Adam Olshen. More modules are being prepared and will be released in near future.
