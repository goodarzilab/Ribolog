\usage{
visualize_CELP(tr_codon_read_count_loess_corrected_list, transcript,
  panel_rows = 1, panel_cols = 1, from_codon = NULL,
  to_codon = NULL, outfile = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{tr_codon_read_count_loess_corrected_list}{A list of codon level read counts for all samples and transcripts.
It is the second element of a tr_codon_bias_coeff_corrected_count object produced by \code{\link{CELP_bias}}.
It has the following structure:
list$<sample.name>$<transcript.ID> data.frame:
[1] codon_number [2] codon_type [3] aa_type [4] observed_count [5] bias_coefficient [8] corrected_count.}

\item{transcript}{Name of the transcript to be plotted}

\item{panel_rows}{Number of rows in the case of plotting multiple samples on one page. Default: 1.}

\item{panel_cols}{Number of columns in the case of plotting multiple samples on one page. Default: 1.}

\item{from_codon}{Plot starts from this codon. Use this and to_codon to zoom in on particular regions of the transcript. Default: NULL (plot starts at the start codon).}

\item{to_codon}{Plot ends with this codon. Use this and from_codon to zoom in on particular regions of the transcript. Default: NULL (plot stops at the stop codon).}

\item{outfile}{Path and name of the output pdf file. If it is not provided, plots will be printed to standard output. Default: NULL.}

\description{
Function to visualize translational stalling (CELP bias) overlaid on observed and corrected read counts.
}
\details{
This function plots the CELP bias coefficient as a curve overlaid on barplots of observed read counts upward
(positive y) and corrected read counts downward (in the nominal negative y range). This allows visual inspection of the
prominent bias positions and a comparison of read count heterogeneity along the transcript before and after
CELP bias correction.
